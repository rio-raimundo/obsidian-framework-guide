# General discussion of Obsidian workflow
- My vault mainly features four types of notes:
  
  1. **Concept notes**:
     - These notes relate to any kind of general concept or idea (e.g., `fMRI`, `Bayesian modelling`, `2AFC tasks`)
     - They are usually quite short, containing a definition and any other thoughts. For mathematical expressions or modelling concepts, they often contain some kind of proof or formalisation.
     - These notes use the `concept.md` template, which is applied by default to notes in the `dictionary` folder using the `Templater` Obsidian plugin. 
  2. **Article notes**: 
     - These notes contain information about a single article, including a list of properties, abstract, article summary, and general notes.
     - Article notes are imported directly from Zotero using the `Citations` Obsidian plugin and the custom `document.js` template, which is run through the `Templater` Obsidian plugin.
  3. **Meeting notes**:
     - These notes contain information about a single meeting. 
     - These notes use the `meeting.md` template, which is applied by default to notes in the `meetings` folder using the `Templater` Obsidian plugin.
  4. **Other notes**:
     - These notes are general other notes, including 'to do' lists, notes for meetings, etc.

# How to use the repository
- Each folder in the repository provides a set of files which can be used to copy the relevant part of the workflow, as well as a general !info.md file explaining that part of the setup.
- There are currently three main sections: 
   1. **Templates**:
      - These are my general templates which I use as the default note layouts for specific folders (including for concept notes). 
   2. **Zotero citations**:
      - This is the most involved part of the repository, and describes my process of bringing in citations from Zotero and populating notes in the vault with them, including my templates.
   3. **Git integration**: 
      - Not many resources to this one, but just a reminder of the links in case I need to set it up again.
