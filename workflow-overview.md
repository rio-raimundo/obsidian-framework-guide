# General discussion of Obsidian workflow
- My vault mainly features four types of notes:
  
  1. **Concept notes**:
     - These notes relate to any kind of general concept or idea (e.g., `fMRI`, `Bayesian modelling`, `2AFC tasks`)
     - They are usually quite short, containing a definition and any other thoughts. For mathematical expressions or modelling concepts, they often contain some kind of proof or formalisation.
     - These notes use the `concept.md` template, which is applied by default to notes in the `dictionary` folder using the `Templater` Obsidian plugin. 
  2. **Article notes**: 
     - These notes contain information about a single article, including a list of properties, abstract, article summary, and general notes.
     - Article notes are imported directly from Zotero using the `Citations` Obsidian plugin and the custom `document.js` template, which is run through the `Templater` Obsidian plugin.
  3. **Meeting notes**:
     - These notes contain information about a single meeting. 
     - These notes use the `meeting.md` template, which is applied by default to notes in the `meetings` folder using the `Templater` Obsidian plugin.
  4. **Other notes**:
     - These notes are general other notes, including 'to do' lists, notes for meetings, etc.
