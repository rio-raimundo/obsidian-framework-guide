This repository is intended to provide a general overview of the framework of my Obsidian academic vaults. It is intended both for my own use in the future when setting up new vaults painlessly, as well as for others who might want to copy parts of the structure.

> NOTE: All `.md` documents within this vault were written in the [marktext](https://www.marktext.cc/) [24.12.11] markdown software, which I recommend for viewing as well. However, any `.md` software should work, including Obsidian itself!
